Elon Musk announced on Monday that the first human has received a brain implant through his Neuralink startup—marking a new step forward for the company and its goal to connect the human brain to computers.
“The first human received an implant from @Neuralink yesterday and is recovering well,” Musk announced in a post on X on Monday evening.
Controlling technology with your mindBCIs have already demonstrated the ability to help individuals to control technology with their thoughts—allowing paralyzed patients to control a robotic arm or move a cursor.
“Right now, for example, Neuralink doesn't go very deep into the brain,” says Chen, noting that another treatment used to treat depression, deep brain stimulation (DBS), targets an area of the brain deeper than Neuralink and other BCIs can currently reach.
(Neuralink did not immediately respond to TIME's request for comment on the potential risks of implantation.)
